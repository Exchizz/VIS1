To compile a cmake project, two steps must be taken:

1) Create a Makefile
cmake is a program which creates Makefiles for you. All the libraries and files included in a given c++ project are defined in a CMakeLists.txt file. By calling cmake on a folder containing a CMakeLists.txt file, a number of files, including the Makefile, are created in the current directory. It is recommened to keep the CMakeLists.txt file in the src folder and create a build folder to run cmake in. In the case of the HelloWoldOpenCV this means running:

cd ~/workspace/HelloWorldOpenCV
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src

You will now have two folders in HelloWorldOpenCV
src: containing the source code, CMakeLists.txt and an image
build: containing a number of files generated by cmake, including the Makefile

2) Compile project by calling make
The project can now be compiled by calling the command make in the folder containing the Makefile. This will create an executable with a name defined in the CMakeLists.txt file. In the case of HelloWorldOpenCV:

cd ~/workspace/HelloWorldOpenCV/build
make

To test if OpenCV is working run the executable HelloWorldOpenCV with an image as argument. For instance:

./HelloWorldOpenCV ../src/bookCover.jpg
